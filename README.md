In this project we are building a food delivery app using MVC, ENTITY and Database first, now i know you came heree to just copy the codes and paste i so that you can be a real programmer, but no you are not :-D , I know you will copy this and show your friends that yaaaa!!!! i did it but let's cut this crap and get back to how you can do,

So, I have attached a database snaps on how the database should be or i would have just upload the database codes also, god knows what i will do , but however make the database on the information i would give you. Now do remember that you change the connection string in the console folder--> app.config.

Now as i am very humble below is the link to the google drive where you can find the code full, again if github does some shit and prevents you from downloading, and because i couldn't upload the package file here, and i know you people won't be able to download that also.

And ya i copy pasted all this readme.md from my previous post, ha ha not funny

# CIAO

PS - I was not able to upload the file here , beacause of some out of this world reasons github is not letting me upload the code as it contains too much file,
so like you i am also a lone coder with no gf and so i upload the code on drive and the LINK is above so go and copy paste it , beacause that is what you do best.
